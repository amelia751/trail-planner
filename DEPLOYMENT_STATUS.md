# Deployment Status

## ✅ Environment Variables Added

All required environment variables have been successfully added to Vercel production:

- ✅ `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID` = trail-476622
- ✅ `GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL` = development@trail-476622.iam.gserviceaccount.com
- ✅ `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` = (encrypted)
- ✅ `GEMINI_API_KEY` = (encrypted)
- ✅ `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` = (encrypted)

## ⚠️ Redeployment Required

Environment variables are added but **require a redeploy** to take effect.

### Current Issue

Git author permission error prevents CLI deployment:
```
Error: Git author anhlam@Lams-MacBook-Air-5.local must have access to the team Amelia Anh Lam on Vercel
```

## 🔧 Solution Options

### Option 1: Manual Redeploy (Recommended - Fastest)

1. Visit Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/amelia751s-projects/trail
2. Click **"Deployments"** tab
3. Find the latest deployment
4. Click **"..."** (three dots menu)
5. Click **"Redeploy"**
6. ✅ Environment variables will now be active!

### Option 2: GitHub Auto-Deploy

1. Make any small change (e.g., update README.md)
2. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update: Add environment variables"
   git push
   ```
3. Vercel will auto-deploy with new environment variables

### Option 3: Fix Git Author (For Future Deployments)

The git author needs to be added to the Vercel team. This can be done in Vercel dashboard under Team Settings.

## 🧪 Testing After Redeploy

Once redeployed, test the API endpoints:

### Test 1: Visit the App
```
https://trail-7tyaguo52-amelia751s-projects.vercel.app
```

### Test 2: Create a Trip
1. Click "Plan New Trip"
2. Use Quick Fill button (🏃 Running or 🥾 Hiking)
3. Click "Create Trip"
4. Should successfully generate route with Google Maps + Gemini

### Test 3: Verify Data is Real
1. Go to "/trips"
2. Click ℹ️ (info icon) on a trip
3. Verify GPS coordinates, landmarks, and knowledge base are populated

### Test 4: Test Offline
1. Create a trip (online)
2. Open DevTools → Network tab → Check "Offline"
3. Go to trip session page
4. Verify GPS simulator, map, and AI chat all work offline

## 📊 Current Deployment

**URL:** https://trail-7tyaguo52-amelia751s-projects.vercel.app

**Status:** 
- ✅ PWA features working
- ✅ Service worker active
- ✅ Offline caching working
- ⏳ API endpoints (waiting for redeploy with env vars)

**Dashboard:** https://vercel.com/amelia751s-projects/trail

## ✅ What's Working Right Now

Even without redeploy, these features work:

- ✅ Landing page
- ✅ Install page (Chrome AI guide)
- ✅ PWA install prompt
- ✅ Offline indicator
- ✅ Service worker caching
- ✅ Chrome AI capabilities check

## ⏳ What Needs Redeploy

These features need environment variables (after redeploy):

- ⏳ Create new trip (Google Maps + Gemini API)
- ⏳ Generate knowledge base
- ⏳ Fetch route and landmarks

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Redeploy manually from Vercel dashboard** (recommended)
2. Test trip creation to verify API endpoints work
3. Test offline mode with a created trip
4. Ready for hackathon submission! 🚀

**Once redeployed, all features will be fully functional!**

## API Costs per Trip

- Google Routes API: $0.005
- Google Places API (5 searches): $0.017
- Gemini API: ~$0.01
- **Total:** ~$0.032 per trip

**Sustainable for demo and production!** ✅

## Offline Chrome AI Integration

Once data is saved to IndexedDB:

### Example User Interactions:

**Q:** "Where am I?"  
**A:** Chrome AI loads GPS from IndexedDB → "You're near Boathouse Row at coordinates 39.9696, -75.1876"

**Q:** *uploads plant photo*  
**A:** Chrome AI uses knowledge base → "Based on the plant identification guide for Philadelphia..."

**Q:** "I twisted my ankle"  
**A:** Chrome AI uses first aid knowledge → "For a twisted ankle while trail running: 1. Stop immediately..."

**All works offline!** ✅

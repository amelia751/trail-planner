# 🚀 START HERE - Trail is Ready!

Your Trail app has been built and is running! Follow these steps to test it.

## ✅ What's Already Done

- ✅ Project structure created
- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ Development server running at **http://localhost:3000**
- ✅ Environment variables configured (except Gemini API key)
- ✅ Chrome AI integration with session pooling
- ✅ Gemini API backend routes
- ✅ GPS simulator component
- ✅ Chat interface with multimodal support
- ✅ Demo scripts and documentation

## ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED: Add Your Gemini API Key

### 1. Get Your API Key (2 minutes)

1. Visit: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Copy the key (starts with `AIza...`)

### 2. Add to Environment File

Open `.env.local` in your editor and replace this line:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

With your actual key:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyAbCdEf...your_actual_key
```

**IMPORTANT**: Don't commit this file to git! It's already in `.gitignore`.

### 3. Restart the Server

```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop the current server
# Then run:
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 Test the App (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Visit the Landing Page
Open **http://localhost:3000**

You should see:
- ✅ Trail landing page with 4-panel grid
- ⚠️ "Chrome AI not detected" message (that's normal!)

### Step 2: Set Up Chrome AI
1. Click "Install Chrome AI" button
2. Follow the step-by-step guide
3. This takes ~15 minutes (includes model download)
4. **Or skip for now** - app will use Gemini API fallback

### Step 3: Test the Trail Session
1. Visit **http://localhost:3000/trail**
2. Wait for "Preparing knowledge base..." to finish (~5-10 seconds)
3. You should see a welcome message in the chat

### Step 4: Try These Queries

**Start GPS first**: Click the Play button on GPS Simulator

Then try these:

```
Where am I right now?
```

```
I twisted my ankle, what should I do?
```

```
What wildlife might I see on this trail?
```

### Step 5: Test Image Upload
1. Click the image icon (📷)
2. Select any image file
3. Ask: `What do you see in this image?`

## 📚 Documentation

- **`SETUP.md`** - Detailed setup instructions
- **`DEMO_SCRIPTS.md`** - Complete list of test queries
- **`README.md`** - Full project documentation
- **`PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`** - What's been built

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "GEMINI_API_KEY not found in environment variables"
→ You need to add your API key to `.env.local` (see step 2 above)

### "Failed to generate knowledge base"
→ Check your Gemini API key is valid and you have internet connection

### Chrome AI not working
→ Visit http://localhost:3000/install for setup guide
→ Or use Gemini API fallback (works without Chrome AI)

### Port 3000 already in use
```bash
# Kill the process using port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
# Then start again
npm run dev
```

## 🎬 Next Steps

1. **Get Gemini API key** (REQUIRED)
2. **Test the app** with demo scripts
3. **Set up Chrome AI** (15 min, optional)
4. **Record demo video** (3 minutes max)
5. **Deploy to Vercel** (optional)
6. **Submit to hackathon**

## 📹 Demo Video Tips

What to show (in 3 minutes):
1. Landing page - explain concept (30s)
2. Trail session - show GPS + chat (90s)
3. Upload image - multimodal demo (30s)
4. Emphasize offline + privacy (30s)

## 🚀 Quick Commands

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## 💡 Key Features to Highlight

1. **Hybrid AI Strategy**: Chrome AI (local) + Gemini API (cloud)
2. **Multimodal**: Text + Image + GPS context
3. **Offline-First**: Knowledge base cached locally
4. **Privacy**: On-device processing
5. **Real Chrome AI APIs**: Not mocked!

## ✉️ Need Help?

1. Check `README.md` for full docs
2. Review `DEMO_SCRIPTS.md` for test scenarios
3. Look at console logs for errors
4. All data is local - safe to experiment!
